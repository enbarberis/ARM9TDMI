# Introduction
This project was created with the goal to obtain a “softcore” processor based on the ARM9TDMI architecture. 
The work was created as a final project for the course “Microelectronic System” taught at Politecnico di Torino by professor Graziano.
The project was developed by:
* Barberis Enrico
* Canessa Emanuele 
* Cipolletta Antonio
* Circa Alessandro
 
# What was done
## Architecture
A first step of reverse engineering to extract inner details of the architecture was done by reading documentation provided by ARM. All the obtained informations are reported in these documents to help future readers:
* `doc/datapath.eps` : an high level datapath view of the processor. This diagram helps to visualize the main blocks that compose the processor.
* `doc/ARM9TDMI_notes.pdf` : a document that explain for each instruction encoding, timing and implementation details 
## Implementation
